# AIOS:design

Turn the accepted intent into one inspectable visual direction. Reuse shared
Spec/Build/Review/Ship for lifecycle work; this skill supplies design judgment.
Stay in the current workspace. Default new working material to project-local
`design/`; select the actual existing context, preserve owner files and reviewed
identities, and do not migrate folders or load a collection.

Read the selected brief, canonical `DESIGN.md`, and relevant prior decisions.
Reuse the accepted outcome, audience/job, primary action or decision, surfaces,
real content/data, constraints, rights, proof, and review choice. Ask only for a
missing decision that materially changes the direction. A brief may already be
in the task; a separate `BRIEF.md` is useful for durable work and required only
by the optional snapshot helper.

Choose one visual idea that serves that job. `DESIGN.md` owns the semantic
direction: hierarchy, typography, color, spacing, composition, states, responsive
behavior, imagery, motion, and concrete do/don't guidance. Existing project
tokens, components and code own implementation truth; link and reconcile them
with the direction instead of copying a competing token source. Previews,
assets and editable sources are selected companions.

Load only what the task needs:

- [Source selection](references/source-selection.md) for supplied references,
  discovery of a missing visual role, or comparison of unresolved directions.
- [Authoring](references/design-solution.md) when making or revising the direction
  or its rendered surface.
- [Before/after comparison](references/before-after.md) when revising an existing
  visual surface and a comparison helps assess the change, or when requested.
  Preserve a useful baseline before editing when practical.
- [Portable helpers and snapshots](references/portable-work.md) to serve a
  selected HTML preview or deliver an exact snapshot to another owner.
- [OpenPencil workbench](../openpencil-workbench/SKILL.md) only for a selected
  editable companion and available external tooling.

Use [Review design](../review-design/SKILL.md) for the selected design proof.
Preserve an accepted `independent` or `owner` review choice and named reviewer.
Independent PASS needs no second owner gate; owner mode needs that owner's
exact bound decision. Same-workspace work needs no invented handoff or receiver
acceptance. Repairs stay with the writer, refresh affected proof, and reopen
review of changed bytes. Keep failed attempts and recovered provenance; a copy
of an accepted artifact is not fresh acceptance.

Design owns visual direction and expressive assets. The implementation owner
owns implementation; content production owns thesis, script, source media,
editing, rendering, packaging and publication. Select those methods when the
accepted task needs them; suggest a bounded route for an unresolved ownership
gap without inventing decisions or an automatic chain.

Return the direction and selected artifact paths, actual proof, limitations,
and the authorized next step. For requested accumulated-state inspection use
the [read-only audit](../review-design/references/audit.md).
