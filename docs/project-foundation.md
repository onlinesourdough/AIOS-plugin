# Project Foundation

## 0.28.0: retired in favor of Factory Foundation

AIOS 0.28.0 removes the `aios-project-foundation` skill, its references and its
native entrypoint. Engineering preparation of a new or existing software
project now uses the separately usable
[Factory Foundation](https://github.com/arcitai/factory/tree/main/foundation/factory-foundation)
skill from [Factory](https://github.com/arcitai/factory). It can be used
directly in Codex or Claude; T3 Code is not required for that preparation.
AIOS has no runtime dependency on Factory, does not install it and does not
copy its content.

Create Project still starts content, research, business and software workspaces,
with Git optional. Small coding work stays direct with Write Code and the
shared Spec, Build and Review. When accepted work needs a substantial
engineering foundation and no such method is selected, AIOS reports the gap.
Immutable `v0.27.0` retains the removed source for recovery. The sections below
are historical records of earlier releases; their links and claims describe
those versions, not the current package.

## 0.17.0: workspace setup and engineering readiness

Create Project now establishes useful context and a simple workspace for
content, learning, business or software work. Git and a repository seed are
optional. Project Foundation retains the distinct responsibility for software
engineering readiness in new or existing projects. The conditional repository
seed shares the established engineering/document criteria; general folder
setup does not load them or imply an application is ready.

Create System is retired. Reusable methods use Manage Skills, while separately
maintained solutions retain their ordinary project ownership. Factory remains
an independent environment and method selected separately by the operator.
See [project creation](project-creation.md) for the scoped change and evidence.

## 0.14.1: independent project contracts

AIOS prepares self-contained projects. Create Project and Project Foundation
share engineering and document criteria: real setup/checks, code standards,
design, application infrastructure, security, CI/delivery and recovery.
There is no external Factory route or runtime-specific skill dependency.
Choosing another execution system is a separate, explicit operator action.

Standards use an existing canonical CONTRIBUTING or coding-standards source.
A new CODE_STANDARDS.md contains only useful project decisions. DESIGN.md stays
the visual entrypoint; a distinct DESIGN_SYSTEM.md is justified by reusable
components, with links instead of duplicated rules. Guidance follows actual
source and is maintained with each relevant change.

Source/package checks and independent review are recorded in verification.
This change does not claim a new live deployment or remote-host qualification.

## Original 0.14.0 evidence (historical)

The accepted outcome is a focused AIOS method for making an MVP/legacy project
ready for reliable engineering and its requested independent factory handoff.
It shares a content contract with Create Project and the canonical Agentic
Project Template, without copying a runtime or reseeding existing projects.

Project Foundation owns the engineering, document, CI/delivery and factory
handoff criteria in its four references. Create Project owns verified template
acquisition/transfer and continuation from accepted facts. APT owns generated
payload and transfer/recovery mechanics. The application owns its actual source,
commands, operating configuration and evidence. The factory owns runtime
execution, review policy and supported adapters. A skill adds no access rights.

The chosen application document layout keeps root README, AGENTS, ARCHITECTURE,
DESIGN, SECURITY and CONTRIBUTING plus docs/README, infrastructure, deployment
and operations. Existing canonical equivalents survive. Testing, ownership,
proof and recovery are covered without mandatory extra pages. The generator's
unresolved seed state cannot satisfy those application obligations. Ordinary
changes update the source that owns the affected facts.

The CI contract retains required PR checks and batches complete work every three
hours. A proven unchanged interval uses only a small metadata runner. Branch and
artifact identity, check failures, actual remote protection and the difference
between configured versus observed schedules remain explicit. A requested
factory handoff needs a real application task and test-environment evidence,
not just an exported kit or successful synthetic runtime demo.

The runtime quickstart and kit were inspected at `facc919bea724256b6002d364a35bca078e6c9b1`
(0.3.5). That version supplies the protected candidate base to differential
checks and returns a reviewed patch; branch/PR/merge/deployment are not
automatically published. The method requires inspecting the selected version
on use rather than treating this observation as a permanent capability claim.

## Verification and recovery

Source validation must cover all 25 skill identities, shared contract links,
per-skill versions, minimal shipped package and unchanged native declarations.
Maintain the existing context ceilings; the foundation references load only for
their selected work. The package remains dependency-free.

Behavioral review uses synthetic repository tasks to distinguish a legacy
repair, a new seed and already sufficient foundations. It checks actual source
reads, repairs, preserved constraints and truthful readiness statements. Static
word/link tests are not a substitute. Application cloud access, production
delivery and live defence monitoring are outside these local evaluations.

Verification results and exact delivery revisions are recorded with the PR and
release. Revert the scoped source change or select the prior package release
for rollback. APT changes apply to newly created repositories; existing projects
are never bulk-regenerated. No owner-home migration is part of this change.

The [bounded Codex observations](evidence/project-foundation-probes.json) record
an actual legacy repair, a resumed already sufficient project and creation of a
working CLI. The legacy task preserved canonical subdirectory documents, license
and application code, corrected the real check route and distinguished remaining
factory evidence. Its recheck added only a missing docs-index link after the
contract was clarified. The creation task populated actual application facts
and preserved proprietary product licensing with separate template attribution.
Its mutable candidate source was reported honestly; Create Project now explicitly
requires an isolated fixed seed and a fresh identity/clean-state check for either
creation route. Local payload tests cover all four generated project kinds.
The final neutral-seed probe used an isolated detached APT source at `33567f3`,
verified its clean identity before and after generation, and observed main with
empty history, no remote, valid routes and preserved unresolved product licensing.
Out-of-place source provenance is in the receipt/task result because the current
helper embeds generic attribution only; no live remote-acquisition claim is made.
