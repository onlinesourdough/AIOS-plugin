# Architecture

AIOS combines portable owner context with Agent Skills for planning, design,
content and reviewed delivery. Native manifests load one root `skills/`
directory. Focused helpers belong to their skills and run only for a selected
task; AIOS has no model runner, background service or permission system.

| Boundary | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Native harness | Projects, sessions, models, tools, permissions and credentials |
| Selected context home and its short entry | Relevant context, source links, decisions and personal skills |
| Spaces | Selectively loaded business or brand context |
| Skills | Reusable methods, standards and judgment, with references and small helpers as needed |
| Project workspace | Local requirements, working files, outputs, proof and recovery; Git is selected when useful |
| Optional System | A separately maintained specialist with its own dependencies or operational needs |
| Native manifests | Package identity and discovery over the same 25 skills |
| Codex sidebar | A host-managed local MCP App for numbered source setup and a dashboard; stores private navigation names/links, with no company-content copy or chat handoff |

## Work and methods

Continue in the current task and workspace. The shared lifecycle resolves the
outcome, then applies Spec, Build, Review and authorized Ship proportionately.
Design and content chain their own specialist steps into this lifecycle. There
is no chain configuration language, mandatory department model or fixed sequence
between design and content. Short writing uses human-writing directly.

The README presents these connected domain workflows as the **Agentic Content
System** and **Agentic Design System**. Each combines context, skills, project
artifacts and selected tools. These built-in systems use this plugin's methods;
they do not require separate installations of the former ACS or ADS repositories.
Diffusion Studio and OpenPencil are optional external workbenches. Their native
interfaces own production, with browser surfaces where supported: OpenPencil's
canvas, local design/application previews, and Diffusion's limited read-only
companion. The current Diffusion companion does not support media elements.

Use project-local `design/` and `content/` for working material and create them
when needed. Product files belong where the project consumes them. Skill
packages contain reusable methods and neutral assets, never customer work.
Domain skills own briefs, evidence, review and handoff details; the core router
only selects a method. See the [skill index](skills.md),
[design preservation map](design-preservation.md) and
[content preservation map](content-preservation.md).

An optional System is useful for a bounded specialist with independent upkeep,
such as Power BI and its Windows Desktop workflow. Its repository owns its
requirements, dependencies, proof and recovery. A script or a long skill alone
does not require a System. Create Project establishes the appropriate workspace
and context. A selected repository template is an optional seed; it does not add
a second project identity or copy AIOS phases. Create System is retired;
reusable methods use Manage Skills. Project Foundation was retired in 0.28.0;
substantial software engineering foundations use a separately selected method,
such as [Factory Foundation](https://github.com/arcitai/factory/tree/main/foundation/factory-foundation),
or the gap is reported. AIOS ships no replacement engineering contract.

[Factory](https://github.com/arcitai/factory) is a separate package of
Foundation, AgentOps and ADLC methods for T3 Code and native coding agents.
The operator may use it with an AIOS-assisted project under the project's
accepted scope. Neither package depends on or installs the other; there is no
runtime integration, shared credential store or automatic software handoff. The
selected execution environment owns its controls.

## Context and isolation

Owner context is selected when the work needs it. Independent repository work
starts from local instructions and accepted inputs, including repositories
nested beneath an owner home. No parent instruction file preloads personal data.
Native project discovery does not depend on an AIOS registry. Existing useful
source indexes can remain ordinary context.

New file owner homes use `AIOS_FORMAT` 2, without mandatory project or system indexes.
The package also reads format 1. Package versions and owner-data formats are
separate; installation never migrates data. An authorized cleanup preserves
existing data and rollback evidence before changing the format marker. See
[data compatibility](../skills/aios-setup/references/data-format.md).

[Context](../skills/aios-context/SKILL.md) selects the provider and owns the common
home contract. A small host pointer supplies fresh-session discovery; the entry
identifies authoritative sources, Spaces, personal methods and maintenance scope.
Notion is the preferred concrete setup for solo founders and small teams. Other
selected homes retain native structures and require verified tools and acceptance.
Source systems retain their operational records and access control.

Docs, Skills and Memory establish a context foundation. An operating model also
needs workflows, responsibility, review points and evidence of useful outcomes.
Start from one real workflow and add context where it improves that work. This
package does not provision an ERP, data integration service or runtime memory engine.

Maintain Context owns facts and explicit continuity Sync. Manage Skills owns
personal-skill placement and native adoption. File-home Sync transfers consented context,
personal skills and identity metadata; it excludes product trees, native
settings, credentials and nested repositories. It is an explicit workflow,
not an installation side effect.

## Selective loading

The harness discovers skill names and descriptions. Load the selected skill,
then only the references needed for its operation. Explaining a method does not
execute its lifecycle. Model selection assesses the remaining work under the
user's configured default; worker orchestration is conditional on a concrete
gain or a request. Shared continuation retains existing action authority.
Risky Changes applies to consequential changes, without creating routine gates.

Clarify is an included explanation method, separate from visual design. The
Global Skills and Skills Atlas repositories are retained as public archives.
Shape Offer and the former guardrail implementation are not included in AIOS.
Explicit protection requests use native harness controls and reviewed maintained
capabilities; installation and actual active protection are verified separately.

## Documentation and native installation

The product repository owns AIOS documentation. Its approved overview at
`docs/aios.md` ships in the native package and states the matching package
version. The primary AIOS skill points to a small
[documentation route](../skills/aios/references/documentation.md), which selects
only the local overview or method reference needed for a question. Including a
file in the package does not preload it into conversation context.

Current releases, changed external facts and gaps in local documentation use the
[canonical source route](../skills/aios/references/canonical-sources.md).
The installed version stays distinct from upstream `main` and newer releases.
Private source reads use already-authorized access. Local documentation and
methods remain usable without that access or website availability.

There is no separate public AIOS documentation export or Resources runtime.
The [release procedure](distribution.md#release-and-adoption) checks package,
overview and tag versions together before publishing a GitHub Release. Customer
documentation remains in its source system; AIOS retains only useful pointers,
unique facts or explicit gaps. Private owner continuity remains a separate flow.

The technical plugin identity remains `aios`. Earlier OSM packages already
required an identity migration to AIOS; renaming it back would change native
registrations and invocation names without improving distribution. The README
distinguishes the shared AIOS plugin from the owner's personal AIOS home.

Codex, Pi, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI and Cursor have native metadata
for the same source. Installation affects only the chosen harness. It creates
no owner home, global bridge, tool installation or registration in another app.
Native removal leaves owner and project data intact. Custom-home routing is an
optional setup choice. See [native installation](native-installation.md) for
actual evidence and documented-only routes.

Source tests verify structure and filesystem behavior. They are author tools,
not proof of model behavior, native UI or future task quality. Historical
acceptance remains version-specific. Current proof and its limits belong in
[verification](verification.md).
